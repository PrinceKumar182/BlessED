# BlessEd
 BlessED empowers individuals, including those with disabilities, to learn, create, and sell unique products, promoting inclusivity and economic growth.


 Introduction
 "BlessED" is an inclusive platform designed to empower individuals from all backgrounds, including
 those with disabilities, by nurturing learning, creativity, and economic independence. The platform offers
 tools and resources that allow users to explore, create, and sell their products while ensuring accessibility
 for everyone. Through collaborations with reputable institutions, BlessED provides diverse tutorials
 catering to various skills and interests.
 The platform features a seller panel where users can showcase their creations and partnerships with
 professional sellers to offer various gifting options. Sustainability is at the heart of BlessED, with revenue
 reinvested to expand content and enhance the user experience.
 Looking ahead, BlessED plans to introduce live classes and additional tutorials, further broadening
 accessibility and creating opportunities for all users to engage, learn, and thrive. The platform also aims to
 connect users with job opportunities by collaborating with companies committed to inclusivity, enabling
 individuals to apply their skills in professional settings and achieve financial independence.
 The Social Problem It Solves
 Millions of people, especially those disadvantaged, struggle to access education, learn new skills, and
 earn a living. Many rely on limited government help or platforms that don’t offer complete solutions. At
 the same time, emerging entrepreneurs and artisans face challenges in showcasing and selling their
 creations. While platforms like YouTube or Etsy address some needs, they don’t provide a single space
 where individuals can learn, create, and sell all in one place. BlessED solves this problem by offering a
 comprehensive platform that empowers users to learn, create, and earn.
 Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
 BlessED addresses following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
 Quality Education (SDG 4): BlessED provides access to educational content and tutorials for everyone,
 regardless of their background. By focusing on building skills and encouraging creativity, the platform
 helps individuals unlock their potential and actively contribute to society.
 Gender Equality (SDG 5): BlessED ensures equal opportunities for all, empowering women and
 marginalized gender groups through tools for learning and creation. By addressing educational and
 economic gaps, the platform works to bridge the gender divide and promote equality.
Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8): Through its seller panel, BlessED enables individuals to
 showcase their creations and collaborate with professional sellers. This initiative fosters inclusive
 economic growth and creates decent work opportunities, particularly for those often excluded from
 traditional job markets.
 Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10): BlessED is dedicated to reducing social and economic disparities by
 providing marginalized communities, the resources to learn, create, and thrive in the economy, fostering a
 more inclusive society.
 Design Methodology
 The design methodology of BlessED follows a structured, user-centered approach aimed at creating an
 accessible platform ,methodology integrates ideation, research, prototyping, and continuous user feedback
 to ensure a high-quality, inclusive user experience.
 1. Understanding Purpose and Goals
 The first step was to define BlessED’s core mission: empowering people through education and help them
 stand in the market. Specific goals include providing accessible,affordable and customized learning
 resources, fostering creativity, and enabling economic independence, particularly for marginalized
 communities.
 2. Research and Analysis
 To ensure the platform effectively meets the needs of its users, I conducted field visits to gather firsthand
 insights. I visited an NGO in Delhi that focuses on empowering students with disabilities. During my
 interaction, the students expressed great enthusiasm for the concept of BlessED and shared valuable
 feedback. They emphasized the importance of accessibility and expressed interest in learning skills such
 as communication, painting, and handicraft creation. Their input has been instrumental in designing an
 inclusive platform tailored to their needs.
 Additionally, I visited Dilli Haat and engaged with several local artists and artisans. They were equally
 excited about the opportunity to showcase and sell their products on our platform. Their enthusiasm
 reinforced the need for a space that connects creative individuals with a larger audience, enabling them to
 gain economic independence and recognition for their work. These interactions have significantly shaped
 the vision and design of BlessED.
 3. Ideation and Brainstorming
 Based on the research, initially we developed a prototype using tools like Figma. Brainstorming was done
 to outline the key features, content structure, and UI/UX design. The focus was on integrating learning
 and selling functionalities, with innovative features like check tools, talk-back accessibility, and a
 user-friendly seller panel.
 4. Prototyping and Design Iterations
 Interactive prototypes were designed using Figma to create a user-friendly and inclusive platform.
The prototypes were shared with friend groups to gather their feedback. Based on their suggestions,
 modifications were made to improve usability and ensure a seamless experience. This iterative process
 helped us refine the design and enhance the platform’s accessibility and performance across various
 devices, making it more aligned with user expectations and needs.
 5. Content Strategy
 Acomprehensive content strategy was developed to include diverse educational tutorials and product
 showcases, catering to various skill levels and interests. To ensure accessibility, features like video
 captions,regional language,practical labs were prioritized. In addition to collaborating with reputable
 institutions , we also curated trusted and highly viewed, liked videos from YouTube to provide users with
 high-quality and engaging content. This approach ensures credibility while offering a wide range of
 learning resources.
 6. Final Design Refinement
 In the final phase, we refined the platform based on user feedback, focusing on usability, accessibility, and
 scalability. Usability and accessibility reviews were conducted to ensure a seamless experience for
 learning and selling. By prioritizing user input, BlessED has created an inclusive platform that empowers
 individuals through accessible education and entrepreneurship.
 Empathy Mapping Analysis
 BlessED’s approach to supporting individuals with underprivileged backgrounds begins by deeply
 understanding the needs and experiences of its target users through empathy mapping.Users often express
 a desire for accessible opportunities to learn and create products that reflect their skills and creativity.
 They ask questions like, "Can I earn enough by selling my creations?" and "Is this platform trustworthy
 and inclusive?" These questions highlight their concerns about financial stability and the reliability of
 available resources.
 The thoughts of BlessED’s users revolve around accessibility, inclusivity, and the sustainability of their
 efforts. They question whether the platform is truly accessible to individuals like them, and whether their
 current skills will be sufficient to create products that customers want. Users often wonder about their
 ability to achieve a steady income stream and whether they can reach their goals in an inclusive
 environment.
 Users actively engage in finding learning resources, participating in online tutorials, and collaborating
 with NGOs to enhance their skills. They showcase their creations through different channels and advocate
 for inclusion within the community. Despite facing challenges, they demonstrate a proactive attitude
 toward learning and growing their capabilities.
 Emotionally, users are hopeful about the possibility of gaining new skills and achieving financial
 independence. However, they also feel cautious and sometimes nervous about whether the platform can
 genuinely help them succeed
 This empathy-driven approach enables the creation of an inclusive environment that addresses users’
 needs comprehensively, from skill acquisition to economic empowerment.
